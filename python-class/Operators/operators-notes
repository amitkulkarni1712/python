Arithmetic operators

    Operators used for basic arithmetic operations are Arithmetic operators

    + - Addition ( adds two values)
    - - Sub ( substracts one value from another)
    * - Mul (mul numbers)
    / - division ( divides)
    % - Modulus operator
    ** - Exponent operator
    // - Integer division

Assignment Operators

    Operator used to store right side value into left side value
    e.g a = 10

    = - Assignment Operator
    += - Adds right operand to left operand & stores the result into left operand
    -= - Substracts right operand to left operand & stores the result into left operand

     **= - pending
     // = - pending

Unary minus operators - Denoted by minus symbol (-)
When this operator is used before a variable the value is negated.

Relational Operators

Relational operator are used to compare two quantities.

> - (a>b) Greater than operator. If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, it gives true else else (e.g - a>b )

>= - a>=b Greater than or equal operator. If the value of left operand is greater or equal than that of right operand, it gives True else False - False

<  - a<=b

<= - less than equal to

== - Equal operator

!= - Not equal to

Logical Operator
---------------

And - x and y . If X is false, it returns X, else Y

or - x or y . If is False, it returns Y, otherwise it returns x

not - not x . If X is False , it returns True, otherwise True - Pending ( Better explanation required)

----------------------------------------------------------

Boolean Operators
x = true
y = False

and - x and y .Both x & y True , Then it returns true else False

or - x or y  . Ether x or y is True. it returns True else False

not - not x   If x is True, it returns False , else true


Bitwise Operator - Pending

----------------------------------------------

Membership Operator

- To test for membership in sequence such list, tuples, dictionary , string

in  -

not in -
