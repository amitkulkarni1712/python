Arithmetic operators

    Operators used for basic arithmetic operations are Arithmetic operators

    + - Addition ( adds two values)
    - - Sub ( substracts one value from another)
    * - Mul (mul numbers)
    / - division ( divides)
    % - Modulus operator
    ** - Exponent operator
    // - Integer division

Assignment Operators

    Operator used to store right side value into left side value
    e.g a = 10

    = - Assignment Operator
    += - Adds right operand to left operand & stores the result into left operand
    -= - Substracts right operand to left operand & stores the result into left operand

     **= - pending
     // = - pending

Unary minus operators - Denoted by minus symbol (-)
When this operator is used before a variable the value is negated.
